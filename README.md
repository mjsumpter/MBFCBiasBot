What is the point of MBFCBiasBot?

MBFCBiasBot is designed with the intention of informing users of the historical bias of an orginazation they may be viewing on reddit. In the age of information, the need for bias analysis and education has become apparent.

I am a novice programmer trying to make things that I think are important. I'm sure there are lots of ways this code can be improved upon, so please feel free to report bugs, provide feedback, or open issues/contribute to the code.

All bias information is from https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/about and not my opinion.
